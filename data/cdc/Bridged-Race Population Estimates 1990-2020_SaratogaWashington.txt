Caveats:
"1. County geography changes over time. New counties are created and old counties are deleted or their boundaries are modified."
"The county codes and names for years 1990-1999 are based on Census 2000 geography; those for year 2000 and later are based on"
"Census 2010 geography."
"2. The U.S. Census Bureau annually releases unbridged population estimates for five-year age groups and race at the county level"
"(http://www.census.gov/popest/research/eval-estimates/eval-est2010.html). The Census Bureau does not release bridged-race or"
"unbridged estimates by single year of age at the county level due to concerns about the reliability of these estimates. However,"
"these estimates are provided to the National Center for Health Statistics to meet programmatic needs such as the creation of age"
"groupings that differ from the standard groupings used by the Census Bureau. Users of the single-year-of-age county-level"
"bridged race population estimates should carefully consider the limited reliability of these estimates."
"3. The query results include the sum of the population for more than one year. To see the population for a single year, either"
"sort by year, or select only one year."
