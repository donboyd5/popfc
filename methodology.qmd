# Cornell methodology

## Principles

-   Population change can be defined using the Demographic Balancing Equation:

**Pop end = Pop start + Births – Deaths + In-migration – Out-migration**

-   The size and sex/age structure of each component depends on the sex/age structure of Pop start.
-   Survivors age (end – start) years and thus a sex/age structure of Pop end can be calculated. This Pop end makes the Pop start for a next period.
